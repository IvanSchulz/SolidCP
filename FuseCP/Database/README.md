# Database Scripts Folder

The database is now managed with EntityFramework Core Migrations. The migrations and the entity classes are located in the project FuseCP.EntityFramework.Data. If you need the old scripts, the legacy SQL scripts are located in FuseCP.EnterpriseServer.Data\LegacyScripts. The script update_db.sql is still needed for updating from FuseCP 1.4.9.
